# CONVENTIONS.md — deskpricer Financial Conventions

This file is the single source of truth for every financial unit,
sign convention, scaling factor, named constant, and P&L attribution
formula used in the deskpricer codebase. Every other file defers to
this document. In case of conflict, this file wins.

## 1. Time Convention

| Symbol | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| `t` | Time to expiry expressed as an ACT/365 year fraction. `t = (expiry_date − today).days / 365`. |
| Calendar days | `t × 365`, rounded to the nearest integer, floored at 1. |
| `MIN_T_YEARS` | `1/365 ≈ 0.002740`. The minimum value of `t` accepted by the pricing engine. Any input `t < MIN_T_YEARS` is silently floored to `MIN_T_YEARS` before being passed to QuantLib. This prevents a numerical singularity in the BSM formula as `t → 0`. The floor is financially acceptable because callers are expected to supply live intraday market data (spot and IV) that already embeds intraday decay; the floor does not introduce meaningful pricing error for any practical 0-DTE workflow. |

## 2. Greek Units

### 2.1 Delta
- **Unit**: dimensionless, ∂V/∂S.
- **Range**:  for calls, [−1, 0] for puts (without dividend carry).
- **P&L attribution**: `delta_pnl = delta × ΔS`, where `ΔS = S_t − S_{t−1}` in price units.
- **No scaling applied.**

### 2.2 Gamma
- **Unit**: per price unit, ∂²V/∂S².
- **P&L attribution**: `gamma_pnl = 0.5 × gamma × (ΔS)²`.
- **No scaling applied.**

### 2.3 Vega
- **Raw QuantLib output**: ∂V/∂σ, where σ is expressed as a decimal (e.g. 0.20 for 20% vol). The raw value therefore represents the price change per 1.00 unit of decimal vol, i.e. per 100 vol-points.
- **Reported unit (market convention)**: per 1 vol-point (1% absolute). Achieved by **dividing the raw value by 100** before storing in `GreeksOutput.vega`.
- **P&L attribution**: `vega_pnl = vega × Δσ_points`, where `Δσ_points = (σ_t − σ_{t−1}) × 100`. The factor of 100 in `Δσ_points` cancels the division-by-100 in `vega`, recovering the correct dollar PnL.
- **Summary**: `vega` as stored = (∂V/∂σ) / 100. `vega_pnl = vega × Δσ_points`.

### 2.4 Theta
- **Unit**: price change per **1 calendar day** (ACT/365 Fixed), forward-looking.
- **Computation**: `theta = V(t − 1/365 years, all else equal) − V(today)`. This is a revalue-based (bump-and-revalue) estimate, not a continuous-time derivative. The shortened expiry is computed by subtracting exactly 1 calendar day from the rolled expiry date used for the base valuation.
- **Sign**: A long option loses value as time passes → theta < 0. This is the P&L sign: theta directly represents how much money is made/lost per calendar day.
- **P&L attribution**: `theta_pnl = theta × calendar_days_elapsed`, where `calendar_days_elapsed` is the count of calendar days in `[valuation_date_{t−1}, valuation_date_t)`, with a minimum of 1 (intraday repricing still charges one full calendar day of decay).
- **Weekend/holiday behaviour**: Weekends and holidays incur theta decay. A Friday-to-Monday hold attributes ~3 calendar days of theta decay (`theta × 3`). This matches Bloomberg, broker risk screens, and FRTB PnL Explain conventions.
- **Worked example**: a long call with `theta = -0.05` loses approximately $0.05 per calendar day, so a Friday-to-Monday hold attributes ~$0.15 of theta decay.

### 2.5 Rho
- **Raw QuantLib output**: ∂V/∂r, where r is a decimal. Raw value represents price change per 1.00 unit of decimal rate, i.e. per 100 rate-points.
- **Reported unit**: per 1 rate-point (1% absolute). Achieved by **dividing raw value by 100**.
- **P&L attribution**: `rho_pnl = rho × Δr_points`, where `Δr_points = (r_t − r_{t−1}) × 100`.

### 2.6 Charm (delta decay)
- **Unit**: change in delta per **1 calendar day** (ACT/365 Fixed), forward-looking.
- **Computation**: `charm = delta(t − 1/365 years) − delta(today)`.
- **Sign**: For a long ATM or ITM call approaching expiry, delta drifts toward 1 (in-the-money convergence) or toward 0 (OTM), so charm can be positive or negative depending on moneyness.
- Charm is **not currently used in P&L attribution** in `pricing_service.py`. It is an output-only Greek. This is correct; charm enters PnL at third order and is excluded by design.

### 2.7 Vanna
- **Unit**: ∂²V / (∂S × ∂σ), expressed per 1% relative spot move per 1 vol-point.
- **Computation**: 4-point central cross-difference. `ds = S × bump_spot_rel` (relative). `dv_points = effective_bump_vol × 100`. The cross-difference formula is:
  `vanna = [V(S+ds, σ+dv) − V(S+ds, σ−dv) − V(S−ds, σ+dv) + V(S−ds, σ−dv)] / (4 × ds × dv_points)`
- **Sign**: For a call option, vanna = ∂delta/∂σ > 0 when the option is OTM (higher vol increases delta of an OTM call). For an ITM call, vanna < 0.
- **P&L attribution**: `vanna_pnl = vanna × ΔS_pct × Δσ_points`, where `ΔS_pct = (S_t − S_{t−1}) / S_{t−1} × 100` and `Δσ_points = (σ_t − σ_{t−1}) × 100`. Note the unit consistency: vanna is per 1% relative spot move per 1 vol-point.

### 2.8 Volga (Vomma)
- **Unit**: ∂²V/∂σ², per (1 vol-point)².
- **Computation**: central second difference: `volga = [V(S, σ+dv) − 2V(S, σ) + V(S, σ−dv)] / (dv_points²)`.
- **Sign**: volga ≥ 0 for any vanilla option (option price is convex in vol).
- **P&L attribution**: `volga_pnl = 0.5 × volga × (Δσ_points)²`.

## 5. P&L Attribution Formula

The full first- and second-order Taylor expansion used in `run_pnl_attribution`:

```
ΔV_explained
  = delta        × ΔS                           [first-order spot]
  + 0.5 × gamma  × (ΔS)²                        [second-order spot]
  + vega         × Δσ_points                    [first-order vol; vega already per vol-point]
  + theta        × calendar_days_elapsed        [time decay; calendar days as described in §2.4]
  + rho          × Δr_points                    [first-order rate; rho already per rate-point]
  + vanna        × ΔS_pct × Δσ_points              [cross spot-vol; ΔS_pct = ΔS / S₀ × 100]
  + 0.5 × volga  × (Δσ_points)²                [second-order vol]

ΔV_actual  = V(S_t, σ_t, t_t, r_t, q_t) − V(S_{t−1}, σ_{t−1}, t_{t−1}, r_{t−1}, q_{t−1})

residual   = ΔV_actual − ΔV_explained
```

All quantities are **per unit** (no position size or qty applied at this layer). Position sizing (multiplication by `leg.qty`) is applied only in `run_portfolio`, not in `run_pnl_attribution`.

Signs: a long call position gains value when S rises (delta_pnl > 0), when σ rises (vega_pnl > 0), and loses value as time passes (theta_pnl < 0). All signs above are for a long position; callers scale by signed quantity.
